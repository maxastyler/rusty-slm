# Rusty-SLM

This is a program for controlling SLMs with rust and python. The server is implemented in rust with grpc, allowing for control from any programming language that can connect to a web endpoint.

## Todo

- Implement a function to return a full list of monitors, and their properties
- Check if fullscreen borderless is the best option for fullscreening the display
- Option to set a monitor by name, rather than number
